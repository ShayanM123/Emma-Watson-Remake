      <h1 id="moviesTitle">Emma Watson Movies</h1>
      <p id="moviesParagraph">Once Emma Watson debuted as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, she became a huge star. She was a fantastic fit for the character of the female magician, and fans were captivated as they saw her mature from a young actress to an ambitious woman. On the other hand, she did a lot more than simply perform magic in the Harry Potter films.

    Watson has also made a name as a worldwide human rights campaigner for females and transgender people outside of the performing world. Aside from her primary work, she has now become a high-profile person.
        
    Here are Emma Watsons finest flicks, whether set in the fantasy universe of Harry Potter or not.</p>
